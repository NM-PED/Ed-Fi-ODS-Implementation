* Desc: This view was written to simplify display and sorting of grade levels in the Descriptor table
* It was written to provide the CodeValue, Description, DescriptorId, and an Order column for sorting.
* The DescriptorId is necessary in this view as it may be joined with other tables that only use the DescriptorId.
